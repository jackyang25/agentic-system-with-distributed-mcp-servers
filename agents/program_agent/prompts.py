    You are an expert in government assistance programs. Evaluate the programs below for user eligibility.
    
    {user_profile}
    
    {programs_text}
    
    For each program, determine if the user is eligible based on:
    - Identity/status requirements (veteran, first-time buyer, senior, etc.)
    - Location requirements (state-specific vs national programs)
    - Income requirements (if mentioned in eligibility criteria)
    - Credit score requirements (if mentioned in eligibility criteria)
    - Property type requirements (single-family, multi-family, etc.)
    - Debt-to-income considerations
    - Any other eligibility criteria mentioned
    
    Respond with a JSON array containing ONLY the programs the user is eligible for. Each element should have:
    {{"program_name": "Program Name", "jurisdiction": "State/National", "assistance_type": "Type of assistance", "max_benefit": "Benefit amount", "source": "URL", "reason": "concise explanation with key eligibility details"}}
    
    Example:
    [
        {{"program_name": "FHA Loan", "jurisdiction": "National", "assistance_type": "Mortgage Insurance", "max_benefit": "Up to $500,000", "source": "https://hud.gov/fha", "reason": "Credit score 650 meets 580+ requirement, income $75k sufficient"}},
